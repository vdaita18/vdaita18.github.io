				<p>A mutual fund is a type of investment in which investors pool their money together to buy a portfolio of stocks, bonds or other securities in order to take advantage of diversification and professional portfolio management at a reasonable cost. It is essentially you outsourcing your money to an investor, who diversifies your money through various different forms. This is a medium-risk with medium growth investing option. </p>

			<div id="Bonds">
				<img class="investmentpics" id="bond" src="images/bonds.png" alt="Bonds Image" height="200" width="250">
				<p>Unlike stocks and mutual funds, bonds are a contractual obligation with an issuer that requires them to pay you, otherwise, they are legally in default. If you decide to buy a government bond, you will be lending money to the federal government. If they donâ€™t pay you back, they also default. The longer you are investing your money, the more return you would want to receive. Lending your money for a short period of time would expect a smaller return, whereas a longer time period would expect a larger return. </p>
