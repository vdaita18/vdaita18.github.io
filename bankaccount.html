				<p>A checkings account is your normal bank account that one usually thinks of. It is an account that stores and safeguards your money, while letting it accrue interest as a "thank you" from the bank. The interest rate depends both on the individual bank as well as the economy. Currently, during the troubling times of the COVID-19 pandemic, interest rates have been in an all time low, making it difficult for banks to earn money off of their customers' bank accounts. This type of account allows you to write checks to withdraw or deposit cash into or out of the account. There are three types of checkings accounts that we will talk about: </p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Basic Checkings Account</dt>
					<dd>for someone who primarily wants to use checks to pay bills or everyday expenses. To avoid fees, some banks require a low minimum balance.</dd>
					
					<dt>Interest-bearing Account</dt>
					<dd>requires a higher balance, and interest is usually paid monthly. A minimum deposit is typically required to open this type of account.</dd>
					
					<dt>Joint Checking Account</dt>
					<dd>for two or more people who are typically in the same household.</dd>

				<p>A savings account should be your best friend and your lifeline for any unexpected situation. These types of bank accounts will allow you to not only save up for an emergency, but also keep it safe and accessible to use whenever you need it. However, unlike checking accounts, you will not be able to access this account as often as a regular checkings account. As a savings account, banks want you to use it solely for savings, not as a regular access to your money. Also, savings accounts have very little interest accrued, so if you were thinking of having a long term savings increase, think again.</p>

			<div id="Roth IRA">
				<img id="roth" src="images/rothira.jpg" alt="Roth IRA" height="200" width="250">
				<p>The Roth IRA is one of the best types of accounts to ever exist. The IRA stands for individual retirement account, meaning that it is dedicated to ensure your retirement is safe and smooth. The difference, however, between the Roth IRA and the regular IRA is striking. The IRA is a retirement account where you will have to pay the taxes for each withdrawal. This can lead to major loss of oportunity, making you lose the chance of earning hundreds of thousands of dollars. Enter the Roth IRA. This counterpart to IRA makes you pay taxes upfront, making withdrawals for retirement tax-free. Here's the game-changer; the Roth IRA, if started in the ages of 18-20, can accrue enough interest to lead to a reitrement cash of over a $1,000,000... tax free! I highly encourage young adults and incoming college undergraduates to create their Roth IRA and take control of your financial future! Make the best choices for your future self, now!</p>

				<h2>Additional Info</h2>
				<p>Making sure you constantly check your bank accounts for any potential threats or breaches to your account. If you check quickly, there is a possibility that the bank can track how the money was illegally transferred and resolve it. In addition, having a combination of these accounts that fit within your budget is key in order to stay on track financially.</p>
